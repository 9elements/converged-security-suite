12 | PSB | Platform Vendor ID is not zero | :x: | - | Should be non-zero
13 | PSB | Platform Model ID is not zero | :x: | - | Should be non-zero
14 | PSB | Read BIOS Key Revision is not zero | :x: | - | Should be non zero
15 | PSB | AMD Key is disabled | :x: | - | If the AMD key is not disabled, the system will still boot AMD signed firmware
